# Pokédex CLI + Web App

A full-stack Pokémon project with a TypeScript backend and a React frontend.  
Implements a Pokémon exploration, catching, inspection, and Pokédex system backed by the public PokéAPI.  
Designed as a portfolio project demonstrating state management, API integration, caching, and UI polish.
